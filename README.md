# TiLove2d_alpha
This is a Love2d library to import worlds From Tiled editor.
You can also import maps, tiles, animations, collisions from Tiled map editor's lua map format.
This is a work in progress as an alpha version.

Since I'm doing an apprenticeship, i d'ont have the time to work on this library.
