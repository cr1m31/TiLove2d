You can import ".world" (world.json) file extension and ".lua" map files that are exported by "Tiled map editor" into your "Love2d" projetcts.

Supported imports:
------------------
- World files.
- Map files (lua format).
  - Tilesets.
  - Tiles.
  - Rectangles.
  - Animations.
  - Collisions. (collison tiles)
  - Layers (as many layers in each map)/(data maps)

Since I'm doing an apprenticeship, i d'ont have the time to work on this library.

Install:
--------
- Download "TiLove2d" in Github by selecting the "<>Code" tab then click on the "Code" button and choose "Download Zip".
- Then unzip (extract) the archive here and you have the "TiLove2d_alpha-master" folder.
- Rename this extracted folder as your project name (the folder should contain a "main.lua" file).
- Now you can use your favourite "Love2d" interpreter as "ZeroBrane or Visual Studio Code..." to lauch "TiLove2d" with its "main.lua" file.

TiLove2d directories and structure:
-----------------------------------
- images folder: put your images and tilesheet images here, you can add any subfolders for various image categories.
  - UI folder: it contains the TiLove2d's button images, let it there as it is.
- lua_maps folder: place your lua maps here (lua maps exported from "Tiled map editor" as ".lua" format).
- tiledFiles folder: place the ".world" files generated by "Tiled map editor" in this folder.
  - ".world" files will be imported automatically by "TiLove2d" when you place them in the "tiledFiles" folder.
  - You can also place any ".tsx" and ".tmx" files in the "tiledFiles" folder if you want that "Tiled map Editor" remembers it as the project directory.
- worldData folder: this is where TiLove2d saves your ".world" files into ".lua" format.
- LICENSE file: this is the MIT license made by Github for "TiLove2d".
- README.md file: this is the text you read here.

TiLove2d files:
---------------
- main.lua file: it's calling "TiLove2d" libraries (modules) and also it sets the anti-aliasing off and the window size.
- mainLinker.lua file: it connects most of the "TiLove2d" libraries (modules).
- tiledToLove.lua file: it renders (draw) tilesets and animations.
